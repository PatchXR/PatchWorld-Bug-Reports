# PatchWorld-public-bug-reports
This repository doesn't have any code, it's just for beta testers, community members and special users of apps made by PatchXR to report bugs in our software.

# Instructions
### 1. Log in / Sign up for a Github account  
You'll need a Github account to report issues and bugs.  
### 2. How to report a bug
In order to fix a bug, we have to be able to reproduce the error or problem you've encountered.  
Therefore, please follow the example format below.  
##### BASIC INFORMATION:

Department        : audio engine/interface/visual/blocks etc.
Brief description : Brief description of the bug
```
*This information lets us know which build/version of the PatchWorld has a problem*
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE BUG:
```
1. Opened hub
2. Selected 'My worlds' tab
3. Clicked on a 'NewWorld_0' patch
```
*If we can't reproduce the bug, we can't fix it!*
##### WHAT I EXPECTED TO HAPPEN:
```
I expected that the patch 'NewWorld_0' will open.
```
*Knowing what you were actually expecting to happen is much more helpful than only knowing what the error was.*
##### WHAT HAPPENED INSTEAD:
```
The patch did not open. A bird flew by the window.
```
*This lets us know what the allegedly bad result was.*  
##### OPTIONAL ATTACHMENTS:
